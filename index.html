  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>At UC Berkeley, as an EECS major, I've balanced intensive academic pursuits with real-world leadership roles from my military tenure. My portfolio boasts of pivotal accomplishments - from spearheading significant logistics operations in Iraq to claiming victory at the Spring 2022 TI Design Contest. My stint as a GBO Leader accentuates my commitment to teamwork and effective problem-solving. Driven by a passion for engineering and computing, I'm always up for new learning experiences, thriving in diverse team environments, and navigating uncharted territories. I'm actively seeking opportunities where innovation aligns with purpose and effciency.</p>
